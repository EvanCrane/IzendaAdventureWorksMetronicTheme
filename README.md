# IzendaAdventureWorksMetronicTheme

## Purpose

The intention of this kit is purely aesthetic. The aim is to show prospects and customers what Izenda's Embedded BI product might look like embedded within an existing application front-end.

## Licensing

This was built using Metronic's legacy Layout 4 AngularJS version.

Many resources from Metronic have been removed, you can license and download [Metronic](https://themeforest.net/item/metronic-responsive-admin-dashboard-template/4021469)
to get the full theme.

## How to use

This repository only contains the UI resources used.

It was built with Izenda's EmbeddedUI and API version 2.5.0.

Reports and dashboards seen in sample materials were designed by me against the AdventureWorks sample database from Microsoft.

You will need to deploy an API, configuration database, and AdventureWorks database to run this instance and replicate what is seen in sample materials.
